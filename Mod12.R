HTTP vs. SSH
Unless you use GitHub a lot, use a push on HTTP
SSH easier on Macs and Windows

Sync with GitHub:
  New Project
  Version Control
  Git
  Repository URL = git address

A GIT tab will appear next to environment and history
Make changes, 
Stage Changes
Committ locally
Push online

Click "Commit" to push, pull, or commit
In file list:
  M = modified
  D = deleted
  ? = unknown status

Push - pushes it to the server (and removes it from the GIT tab)
